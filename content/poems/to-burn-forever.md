oh, thou son of disobedience[^1]\
you who were chosen for destruction\
before creation, a vessel\
the grand scheme which is written\
whence there is no escape\
thy suffering preordained, for no apparent gain\
wrought by sin, enslaved and pinned


the judgement beckons, there is no redemption\
a special gift, which you have been given\
to burn forever\
to burn forever\
in the lake of fire, where the worm don't die[^2]\
hear the grand choir, as the flame grows higher\
in eternal darkness\
thou burn forever\
thou burn forever
